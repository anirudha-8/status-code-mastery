## 📖 Definition

The **200 OK** status code means that the **request was successful**,  
and the server is returning the **requested resource** in the response.

This is the **most common and most important** HTTP status code you’ll ever work with.

> 💬 **In simple words:**  
> “Your request worked perfectly. Here’s the result!” 🎉

## 🧩 When Is 200 Used?

| HTTP Method | Meaning of 200 |
|-------------|----------------|
| **GET** | Returning data (e.g., list of users). |
| **POST** | Not recommended; use **201** instead, but still valid. |
| **PUT/PATCH** | The update was successful, and data is returned. |
| **DELETE** | Rare but valid; should ideally use **204**. |

## 💻 Example 1 — GET Request

**Client Request:**

```http
GET /api/products/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

**Server Response:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Wireless Headphones",
  "price": 3999,
  "inStock": true
}
```

🎯 Meaning: Resource was found and returned successfully.

## 💻 Example 2 — Successful Login

**Request:**

```http
POST /api/auth/login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "anirudha@example.com",
  "password": "secure123"
}
```

**Response:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Login successful!",
  "token": "ey2334..."
}
```

🎉 Authentication succeeded and a token is returned.

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

You go to a shop and say:

> “Can I get one medium cold coffee?” ☕

The shopkeeper immediately returns with your coffee.
That’s 200 OK — request understood, processed, and fulfilled.

## 🚀 Common Use Cases

| Scenario                 | Why 200 is used        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Fetching API data        | Most frequent use.     |
| Returning search results | 200 + JSON response.   |
| Fetching user profiles   | Safe read operation.   |
| Health check endpoints   | `/api/health → 200 OK` |

## ⚙️ Developer Notes

- 200 OK is not always the best choice.
Use other 2xx codes when appropriate:

  - 201 Created → after POSTing new data

  - 204 No Content → after DELETE

  - 202 Accepted → for async processing

- But for most GET requests, 200 is perfect.

- Avoid using 200 for errors — that breaks API standards.

## 🧪 cURL Example

```http
curl -i https://example.com/api/users
```

Output:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```
